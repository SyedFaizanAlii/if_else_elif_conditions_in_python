# School Age Calculator Script:

This Python script, named School_age_calculaot, is designed to determine whether a student is eligible to enroll in a school based on their age. The user is prompted to enter the student's name and age, and the script then evaluates the age against predefined criteria. The eligibility conditions are as follows:

If the student's age is exactly 5, a message is displayed congratulating them on being eligible to enroll in school.

If the student's age is less than 5, a message indicates that they are too young to enroll.

If the student's age is 18 or older, a message advises them that they are too old for the school and suggests contacting higher school administration.

If the age does not fall into the above categories, a generic congratulatory message for enrollment is displayed.

The script aims to provide a simple age-based eligibility check for potential students and includes user interaction for input.
